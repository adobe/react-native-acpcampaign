`@adobe/react-native-acpcampaign` is a wrapper around the iOS and Android [AEP Campaign SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/adobe-campaign-standard/) to allow for integration with React Native applications. Functionality to enable Adobe Campaign Standard is provided entirely through JavaScript documented below.


## Installation

You need to install the SDK with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and configure the native Android/iOS project in your react native project. Before installing the Campaign extension it is recommended to begin by installing the [Core extension](https://github.com/adobe/react-native-acpcore).

> Note: If you are new to React Native we suggest you follow the [React Native Getting Started](<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html>) page before continuing.


### 1. Create React Native project

First create a React Native project:

```bash
react-native init MyReactApp
```

### 2. Install JavaScript packages

Install and link the `@adobe/react-native-acpcampaign` package:

```bash
cd MyReactApp
npm install @adobe/react-native-acpcampaign
```

#### 2.1 Link
This package requires React Native 0.60+ to build which supports [CLI autolink feature](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) to link the modules while building the app.
